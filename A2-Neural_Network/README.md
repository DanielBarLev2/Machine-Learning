Simple Neural Network

Building a simple Neural Network from scratch via a implementation of forward/backward propagation process.

To run:
1. Install and load mnist dataset.
2. Create a model of class NeuralNetwork and fill the constractor as needed.
3. Tweak the hyperparameters.
4. run the .evaluate function to train the model on five randomized folds.
